Starting a new year without the usual celebrations that entail was strange. I feel like we have not left March 2020.

At the start of 2020, I had not fully outlined plans beyond attending a festival during the Summer.

When plans were cancelled (or postponed) due to the pandemic, I had great intentions to build software to help and potentially start a business.
However, even these replacement plans were postponed so I could focus on my core commitments: family, friends and work.

This year I feel more positive about what I can commit to achieving.

## Learn More

To start my list of commitments is __Learn More__, which was going to be __Read More__ but reading does not imply long-term understanding.

This year I will commit to self-improvement through learning more about technological areas I have an interest in.

This commitment was also driven by my latest role.
This role has required me to expand my existing knowledge and is an area that I believe to be always evolving.

## Share More

Tying into the previous commitment, [__Learn More__](#learn-more), my second commitment I am making is __Share More__.

I have always been an advocate for sharing my knowledge and empowering others.

Through the written medium like this blog, vocally through a podcast or visually through online tutorials; I will share what I have learned as we go through 2021.

## Collaborate More

2020 was a year of isolation for many of us.
While the start of the pandemic brought virtual pub quizzes and catch-ups over a video call, nothing has replaced face-to-face interaction for me.

While more possible in my new role and hopefully through new relationships, my last commitment in 2021 is to __Collaborate More__.

Nothing built well and lasting forevermore was built in isolation.
