## New Beginnings

What better way to start the year off with a goodbye.
I had left my previous role and started my new one as a software consultant.

I also moved to a new city, having lived most of my life in the North East of Scotland, it was time to experience a bigger and more culturally diverse city.
Edinburgh, known best for being the capital of Scotland but also by it's Fringe Festival and wonderful landmarks.

While restrictions were in place, starting to find my feet in Edinburgh was initially tricky.
However, as they eased off over the summer, it was great to try out the numerous drinking holes and eateries in the city centre.

## Notable Achievements

I achieved one of my main goals for the last couple years, thanks in part to my workplace, helping me to attain Microsoft certification for Azure and Power Platform.
The opportunities made available through my work have been fantastic, it has been great working with such clever and friendly people.

Final "achievement" for 2021 was finally catching SARS-CoV-2, which we have all been trying to avoid since the start of 2020.
This unfortunately coincided with the Christmas holidays, leaving me to _enjoy_ my tasteless Christmas dinner to myself.
Fortunately, I believe I have made a full recovery and I can only put that down to effectiveness of the vaccines.

## Looking Ahead

While we continue to collectively experience the pandemic, I hope we can begin to experience more of the normal we once had.

Attaining more certification within the cloud space, specifically in Azure and AWS. While also progressing towards certifying in the use of Kubernetes.
